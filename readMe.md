Part of thesis work to estimate biomass from point clouds including techniques to upscale estimates when training data is limited.

The synthetic data is generated from a specified distribution and allometric equations from the literature in `biomassFromCanopyAreas.R`.  The species-agnostic allometric equation is fit in `cv.py`.
